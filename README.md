# Gemini AI Chatbot

Gemini AI Chatbot is a React-based application that allows users to upload a file and ask questions about its contents using the power of Gemini AI. The app is designed to help users identify, understand, and decide whether to keep or delete files based on their contents.

## ðŸ§  What It Does

- Upload a file (text, document, etc.)
- Ask natural language questions about the file
- Get intelligent responses powered by Gemini AI

I built this app to solve a real problem I had â€” figuring out what old or unlabeled files actually contained so I could clean up my storage more confidently.

## ðŸš€ Tech Stack

- **React** â€“ Front-end framework
- **JavaScript** â€“ Application logic
- **Tailwind CSS** & **Bootstrap** â€“ Styling and layout
- **Jest** â€“ Unit testing
- **Gemini AI** â€“ File content analysis and Q&A

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose

I built this app solo as a personal project to blend AI capabilities with practical file management. Itâ€™s both a learning project and a useful utility I actually needed.
